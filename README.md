# Arduino NodeMCU 12E - Home Temperature and Humidity Meter

## Introduction

This project involves creating a Home Temperature and Humidity Meter using a
NodeMCU ESP8266-12E, a DHT11 sensor, and a LCD1602 screen. The DHT11 sensor is
responsible for measuring the temperature and humidity levels, and the LCD1602
screen displays the real-time data.

Right now I am not making any use for the WiFi module, but I plan to connect the
sensor data to a web service and create an IoT application.

## Components Used

- NodeMCU ESP8266-12E
- DHT11 Sensor
- LCD1602 Screen
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Features

- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring.
- Display of temperature and humidity readings on the LCD1602 screen.
- Display a message based on the Heat Index.
